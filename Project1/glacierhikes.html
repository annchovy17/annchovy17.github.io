    <p><i>Glacier</i> Experience is a small group experience that offers an easy 
    glacier hike on Solheimajokull glacier with an experienced glacier guide and is available all year round. The tour offers a

    Solheimajokull glacier is an outlet from the mighty Myrdalsjokull and is surrounded by some of Iceland's most grand volcanoes and during summertime, a glacier lagoon forms in front of the glacier only adding 
    to the charm of the location. This popular day tour is the perfect way to get in real contact with the true reason behind the name Ice-land!</p>
